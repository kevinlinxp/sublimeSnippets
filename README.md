## sublimeSnippets

Summarising useful pieces of code into reusable [Sublime Text Snippets](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/snippets.html) makes my programming life much more easier and funnier.

I also developed [an IntelliJ plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10446-sublime-snippets-support/update/43269) to make sublime snippets collection like this to be usable in IntelliJ IDEs. The source code is in [the repository next door](https://github.com/kevinlinxp/intellij-sublime-snippets-support).

Hope you could find them useful.
